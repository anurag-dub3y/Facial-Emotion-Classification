# Facial Emotion Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize emotions from facial images. The model is trained on the CK+48 dataset, focusing on emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, and fear.

## Project Structure

### Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are:
- To build a CNN model for emotion recognition.
- To visualize and interpret the CNN model's learned features.
- To provide a brief understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks' role in emotion recognition.
- To observe the effects of changes in hyperparameters on the result.

## Dataset
The CK+48 dataset contains images depicting various facial expressions, classified into different emotions.

- **Total Images**: 931
- **Emotion Classes**: Happy, Surprise, Anger, Sadness, Fear

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of several convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers for classification.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the `main.ipynb` file.
2. Upload it to Google Colabs as `New Notebook`.
3. Press `Run All` to run the entire project.

## Usage
The model can be used for predicting emotions in facial images. 

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of about `70%` on the test dataset.
